When the player chooses the country, show all their starting indexes and rates
Rate different countries on different difficulties based on their default indexes

News:
-> News that show on top of the screen with logs of what happened during the given turn
5 types/levels: unrelated, mixed results, good, bad, catastrophic.

unrelated -> to make the game fun (we can use the year the player is on to make fitting jokes) (color gray)

Game status:
-> Indexes that have the power to end the game
Environmental:
    Co2 emissions (low is good, high is bad: decreased by green initiatives and increased by non-green)
    Energy use (low is good, high is bad: decreased by upgrades that force people to use less energy etc)
    Renewable energy usage/production (low is bad, high is good: increased by research, decreased by selling it)
    Average temperature (too low is bad, too high is bad)
Social:
    Public well being index (low is bad, high is good: affected by temperature, co2, currency value)
    Public acceptance (low is bad, high is good: affected by unpopular/popular laws)
Political:
    Right parties acceptance (low is bad, high is good: affected by decisions that affect the country's economy/structure)
    Left parties acceptance (low is bad, high is good: affected by decisions that affect the country's economy/structure)
Economical:
    Currency value (low currency value is bad, high is good: affected by technological advancement)
    Income < spending
        We could standardize the currency as dollars or carbon footprints


Upgrades:
We could divide upgrades in tiers that will show up as the game goes by:
Tiers 1 (best) to 5 (worst), starting the game with tier 5.

Tier 5:
    Paint all houses roofs white so they reflect more solar light -> decreases average temperature
    Invest in renewable energy research -> decreases co2 emissions by a little bit
Tier 4:
    Increase the price of electrical energy for the home consumer -> decrease energy use and public acceptance
Tier 3:
    Increase the price of electrical energy for factories -> decrease energy and devalues currency
    Invest in renewable energy research and implementation -> decreases co2 and values currency and income
    Sell renewable technology to other country for a high price -> decrease acceptance of both political parties and
        gives money
Tier 2:
    Force all factories to have at least 50% of its energy being renewable -> decrease energy and devalues currency
Tier 1:
    Switch country's energy generation from coal to renewable sources (requires having purchased research earlier)
    Buy renewable technology from another country (cost more but don't require prior upgrades purchased)
