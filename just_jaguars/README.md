### Introduction
As the only investor in a major energy company, seeing global warming picking up and your Public Relations falling proportionally makes you decide to do something. Picking up the helms of the company, you need to make sure you produce enough energy to meet the demand, but also decrease your emissions to keep the Public happy.

### Gameplay
Left-click an icon: buy one of those sources of energy.
Right-click an icon: sell one of those sources of energy.

The brown icons are fossil fuels, which output 10 `energy`, but they also emit emissions. The green icons are green energy, which only output 1 `energy`, but don't emit emissions. The rare blue icons increase your "emissions offset", making it easier to win.

You win by making the percent of fossil fuels less than or equal to the "emissions offset".
However, you lose by either not meeting the energy demands, or if your total emissions pass the limit.
