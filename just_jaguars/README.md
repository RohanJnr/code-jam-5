### Introduction
As the new CEO of Iconic Energy, Inc., the global energy monopoly company of the future, seeing global warming picking up and your public relations falling proportionally makes you decide to do something. Picking up the helms of the company, you need to make sure you produce enough energy to meet the demand, but also decrease your emissions to keep the public happy.

### Gameplay
Left-click an icon: buy one of those sources of energy.
Right-click an icon: sell one of those sources of energy.

The brown icons are fossil fuels, which output 20 `energy`, but they also emit emissions. The green icons are green energy, which only output 1 `energy`, but don't emit emissions. The rare blue icons are greenhouse gas capture technologies, these increase your "emissions offset", making it easier to win.

You win by stopping the increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas levels before they reach the tipping point of a runaway greenhouse gas effect. This happens when the percent of energy coming from fossil fuels is less than or equal to the emissions offset gained from your capture technologies.

You lose when your energy output doesn't meet the energy demand (represented on the energy output bar by the black line), or if the atmospheric greenhouse gas levels reach the tipping point (this happens if the Atmospheric GHG Levels bar is filled).
