# Documentation: CorruptClimate

## Description

CorruptClimate is a global warming simulator.

While not being truly realistic, it shows how dangerous climate change is.

## Requirements

Requires python 3.6.7+ (and pip)

## Setup

Firstly, change your directory to `corrupt_cats`:

```
$ cd <code_jam_root>/corrupt_cats
```

Secondly, install all required dependencies:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And, lastly, run the app:

```
$ python -m start
```

## Notes

* Game takes ~10-15 seconds to load, because of "random generation" (shuffling) of country islands.

* The background ambient might be too loud, just lower your device's volume in that case.

(I highly recommend to playtest the volume of `/corrupt_cats/game/sounds/bg_ambient.wav` before running the app)

## How to play

There are no controls, really. As it was stated, CorruptClimate is a simulator.

Just run it and have fun watching humanity disappear -.-)/

## Simulator explanation

Each country has it's own start temperature.

At start, country.cfc is equal to zero, and country.industry_level is random number between 1 and 2

Country's parameters start changing according to the following:

```python
country.cfc = country.cfc + country.industry_level * (country.temperature/10 + sqrt(abs(country.population))/100)
# country.cfc is rounded to integer

country.temperature = country.temperature + sqrt(country.cfc)/150
# country.temperature is rounded to first two digits after floating point

k = abs(a*b/10)
# k is rounded to integer

country.population = country.population + x
# where x is (-50k) if country.temperature-country.start_temperature > 40, and (k) otherwise.
```

So, according to formulas, you can see, that population is growing until difference between temperature and start_temperature is less than 40,

And then the population starts decreasing quite fast

If you really think there is a bug, see `In case any problems...` section below.
