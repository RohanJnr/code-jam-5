## **Overview**

Hello welcome to the Practical Pourcupine project, made for the 5th [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com/) code jam! The theme of this code-jam was about climate change, as you can see from the top-level README.md, found [here](https://github.com/scOwez/code-jam-5/blob/master/README.md).

We have 3 "mini-projects" (3 different projects that *could* be in seperate repos but due to the code jam, are all housed under one roof). We have the `flask_api`; this is the api part of our web-based project. **This API gets a request and uses interpolation to return and predict the Global Median Water Level**.

The *Global Median Water Level* is a mesurement used by organizations like NASA to monitor the rise/fall in sea level, year by year. Our dataset uses the GMWL in 10-day intervals, starting from 1993 and ending in Febuary 2019.

The two other "mini-projects" are the ones sending and handling the returns, one is called `discord_bot` & it is a Discord Bot *(duh)*! The other is a web-portal (`flask_webportal`) made using Flask and a small bit of Bootstrap for styling purposes, allowing users to experiance and interact with our api as if it was a full production enviroment. This is similar to the discord_bot but showcases another, more flexible usecase for this api.

By doing all of this, we have effectivly created a production-ready ecosystem around our steady RESTful API using multipule technologies to accomplish this feat in the codejam deadline.

### Technical side

Alright, onto the more technical side:

We have an api (named `flask_api`), a webportal (named `flask_webportal`) and a discord bot (named `discord_bot`). The api recives 2 dates formatted using (mainly) `%Y-%m-%d %T` formatting (UNIX). An example of this is: `2019-07-02 14:33:59` (at the time of writing). This would look like: `The 59th second of the 33rd minute of the 14th hour of the 2nd of July, 2019` if said in speech. Please note that the API can accept other dates, this formatting is just the preferred way :)

Once it has those, the `core` returns those (it's one large frontend function) and the api (remember `flask_api`) returns the difference in water level between them two dates in millimeters, as either a prediction or as an accurate difference from histroical data.

Say you put in somewhere in 1950 and somewhere in 2019, it would give me somewhere in the region of 20000mm but it'd be as accurate as it could, interpolating the points in-between the years, couples with machine learning to predict before the dataset that we selected to give a precise value.

Once it sends out this return, we have a simple discord bot and webportal (webportal = a small website connected to the api, `flask_api`) that you can see the results on. For the discord bot (`discord_bot` in files), you could put 1950 and 2000 in like so: `?gmwl 1950 2000` and it would return an answer.

Below is the outline of what the dependancies do:

- `pipenv`: Package manager
- `flask`: Web Framework for flask_api and flask_webportal
- `discord.py`: Python bindings/api for discord_bot
- `flask-sqlalchemy`: Database abstraction for flask_api core maths (storing data on GMWL)
- `flask-restful`: Consistant RESTful API building for flask_api
- `aiohttp`: Asyncronous requests for discord_bot to prevent any "freezing" of it
- `requests`: Syncronous, easy to use api requests for flask_webportal to contact flask_api.
- `flake8`: Linter specfic for `code-jam-5` (required for review)
- `black`: Developer-used autolinter for sake of standardized clarity
- `python-dotenv`: For the `.env` file with pipenv
- `toml`: A small library for toml files (`config.toml`)
- `scipy`: Interpolation & prediction (the maths part of the core for `flask_api`)
- `flask-wtf`: WTForms plugin for flask, allows the dateform used to function properly with POSTs

## Important Extras

### Mini-project Notice

***Please note that `discord_bot` or `flask_webportal` communicate **only** though the api, not just calling a shared function. The only shared infomation between these 3 projects is a config as not to collide with each others hosting and a couple of exeptions that are 2x `class ExceptionName: pass`. Therefore in 10 minutes, you could easily seperate these 3 mini-projects into seperate repositories.***

### Dataset Acknowledgement

*GSFC. 2017. Global Mean Sea Level Trend from Integrated Multi-Mission Ocean Altimeters TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, OSTM/Jason-2 Version 4.2 Ver. 4.2 PO.DAAC, CA, USA. Dataset accessed [2019-06-30] at [http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/GMSLM-TJ42](http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/GMSLM-TJ42).*

## Quickstart (Please read this section to start up the application)

1. Please edit `CLIENT_TOKEN` from the `.env` file inside of the base folder, next to `Pipfile` to the bot's token. If you do not know how to get a discord bot made and get the token, click [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).
2. Install pipenv with `pip install pipenv` (NOTE: May be `pip3` on Linux)
3. Enter pipenv's shell with `pipenv shell`
4. When in the pipenv shell, run `python -m practical_porcupine flask-api` to start the api
5. To start the webportal, **open a new terminal** and repeat step 3 & 4 with `flask-webportal` instead of `flask-api`
6. To start the discord bot, **open a new terminal** and repeat step 3 & 4 with `discord-bot` instead of `flask-api`. Make sure you have step 1 set properly for this one
7. Finished! Please follow the pointers below to view all mini-projects in action:
   - Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view `flask_api` (you will have to pass in specific values for `date_1` and `date_2`)
   - Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5001 to view `flask-webportal`
   - Go onto a channel with your discord bot that has the `CLIENT_TOKEN` set like that and type in `?gmwl 2005 2019` to see between those 2 dates. You can also do `?help` to see the standard help message or `?about`.

## **Development Section**

### General Notes

- When connecting to the api (`flask_api`), it is favourable to use the `%Y-%m-%d %T` time formatting (UNIX annotations with `%`). An example of this is: `2019-06-29 23:02:05` (at the time of writing). This would look like: `The 5th second of the 2nd minute of the 23rd hour of the 29th of June 2019` if said in speech. The api can use other times but it is best to standardize with this method. Despite this, here are some of the other methods you can use: `%Y:%m:%d:%H:%M:%S`, `%H:%M:%S %d.%m.%Y`, `%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S`, `%d.%m.%Y`, `%m/%d/%Y`, `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`
- Autoformat using `black` and try to do a final sweep with the custom `flake8` rulings.
- Document everything in docstrings. `>` means overview of passing in (only used with 2+ args), `<` means overview of returning, `x` is the execption handling and `-` are the argument specifics (use these like bullet points with them symbols).

### API Error codes

- `400`: API was given a bad date format (`DateFormatError`)
- `1001`: API returning wrong values (usually happens in debugging when hooked upto a dummy api)
- `1002`: Date is out of range of dataset. *NOTE: This http code is decrept but should stay for the sake of legacy*.
