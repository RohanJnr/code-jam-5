# Welcome to `Who Wants To Be A Billionaire`

billionaire trying to find their way around their new found wealth. 

You will have a series of opportunities to choose investments, each

# How to play

Upon start up you will be prompted for your name, and then presented
with various investment opportunities. Each of which will cost different
amounts, and have different effects to impact your planet's climate. The
more you invest into a certain organization, the further their policies 
will go. <br>
<br>
You can view the impact a certain investment will have on your world by
submitting the company's number. You can then choose your investment by
submitting: `invest <number>`. <br>
Once you have chosen which you want to invest in and confirm your 
selection, the round will end. Each round takes place over five years. 
You will be presented with news of the current state of the world, and 
you will then choose your investment for the next round. <br>
<br>
After ten rounds your final score will be calculated as a function of 
your net worth and how much money you managed to make. Feel free to 
access the in-game help menu at any time by submitting `help`, and good 
luck!<br>
