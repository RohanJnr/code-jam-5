A game to destroy non-electric cars. Your score increases or decreases depending on what cars you let go or destroy and the aim is to gain as many points as possible. It is a GUI based game written entirely in python using pygame.

Requirements
-
You must have pygame installed. To do this, you can run `python -m pip install pygame` in the command prompt.
To start the game, just run the python file GUI.py.

Future Releases
-
In future releases, our plan would be to add more cars, more gamemodes, a scoreboard, glitch fixes and more once we have more experience of pygame (we started with none).
