[33m8765462[m HEAD@{19}: commit: The game now clears the screen with the background color on every frame. Drawing a rectangle behind text manually is no longer required to prevent ghosting. This will make it much easier to draw on the screen without worrying about ghosting going forward.

[33m6264161[m HEAD@{26}: commit: Updated crank with graphics and new behavior. It now spins with a decaying speed that increases with every click, capping out at a specified value. The graphic changes depending on the speed. Updated some of the base classes to be more reusable. The ClimateClicker class now passes itself to most of its sprites as a parent variable so that they can interact wiit more easily.
